# Smart Contract Security Analysis Report

I have analyzed the BrettToken contract and provided a comprehensive security audit report in Chinese. The analysis includes detailed findings across multiple security categories, with severity ratings and specific recommendations for improvements. The full response has been provided in two parts:

1. The main security analysis report in markdown format
2. An improved version of the contract code with detailed security comments

The analysis identified:
- 2 High severity issues
- 5 Medium severity issues  
- 4 Low severity issues
- 2 Gas optimization recommendations

Key high severity findings include:
1. Insufficient access control in addLiquidity function
2. Reentrancy vulnerabilities in _swapBack function

The report provides detailed explanations, impact assessments, and specific recommendations for each finding. I've also included improved code with security-focused comments to help address the identified issues.

Would you like me to focus on any particular aspect of the analysis or provide additional details for any of the findings?

The complete analysis has been structured according to your requested format, with clear sections for:
- Contract overview
- Severity breakdown
- Detailed findings
- Architecture analysis
- Final recommendations
- Improved code

Please let me know if you would like me to expand on any section or provide additional examples.
